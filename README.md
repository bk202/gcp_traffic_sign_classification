# gcp_traffic_sign_classification

1.Implementation of a traffic sign classifcation network using tensorflow's CNN api following the tutorial on https://navoshta.com/traffic-signs-classification/.

2.The project was written in template using https://github.com/bk202/Tensorflow-Project-Template so that it can be trained on GCP.

3.Training data is not uploaded, but can be downloaded and pre-processed following Alex's tutorial, or ask the author of this repository for training data.

5.Hyperparameters are defined in task.py, edit this file to configure hyperparameters.

4.Run task.py to start training model, model will be loaded automatically everytime before training starts if a saved model exists, otherwise model will be trained from scratch.
